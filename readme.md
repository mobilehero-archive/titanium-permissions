> Titanium native mobile widget for permission requests

## üìì   &nbsp; Description

For use with requesting native device permissions on iOS and Android

## üö® &nbsp; Notice

> ~~There are 7 identical style files that are included in the `./styles` directory.  The reason for this is there are issues with how TSS stylesheets are loaded from widgets in Alloy and it does not currently support the concept of a widget-wide `app.tss` file.   Any changes done to one file will need to be replicated in all the other files.  Sorry about this and hopefully I can create a workaround for this in a future version of `Turbo`.~~
> 
> ~~https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-19971~~

------

I am pleased to say that the latest version of Titanium Turbo now has support for `app.tss` (albeit in an unusual way...).  A feature was added to `Turbo` that allows you to add a `style` tag to your XML view which in turn, supports the `src` tag (not unlike the `script` tag).  

Take a look at the implementation to see how `app.tss` is used to support widget-wide styles (and more!)

------

## ‚ú®   &nbsp;  Features

### Prompts for device permissions


* [X] Permissions for Camera
* [X] Permissions for Location
* [X] Permissions for Microphone
* [X] Permissions for Notifications
* [X] Permissions for Photos
* [X] Permissions for Music

### Styling

You can override the styling for any control using the ID of the control.

IDs follow the pattern `permission-{feature}-{control}` 

Controls used are:  

- lottie (iOS)
- image (Android)
- title
- ask
- go
- later

i.e.

```css
"#permission-camera-title": {
	"color": "blue"
},
```


## üöÄ   &nbsp; Getting Started

### Installing

> Please ensure there is a package.json file in the target directory.  If there is not one present, you can create one with `npm init`.


If you wish to install this in an app using Titanium Turbo, you can execute this in the project root directory:

```bash
npm install @titanium/permissions
```

### Usage

```javascript
const { camera } = require('@titanium/permissions');
```

```javascript
	const permissions_camera = await camera.ensure()
			.catch(error => {
				console.error(error);
			});
```
